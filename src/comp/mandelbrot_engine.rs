//! Mandelbrot set computation engine with multithreaded support.
//!
//! This module provides the core fractal computation algorithms for the Mandelbrot set.
//! The engine supports both shuffled (randomized) and linear computation patterns,
//! with thread-safe cancellation and progress tracking.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - `MandelbrotEngine`: Thread-safe computation controller
//! - Atomic state management for concurrent access
//! - Interruptible computation with graceful stopping
//! - Multiple computation strategies (shuffled vs linear)
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! Uses the classic Mandelbrot iteration: `z(n+1) = z(n)² + c`
//! - Escape radius: 2.0 (squared: 4.0)
//! - Configurable maximum iteration count
//! - Returns both iteration count and final z-value for enhanced coloring
