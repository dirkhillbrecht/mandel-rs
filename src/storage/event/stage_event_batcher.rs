//! Async event batching system for efficient computation-to-visualization communication.
//!
//! This module implements a sophisticated async event batching system that optimizes
//! the flow of computation updates from parallel computation threads to the
//! visualization system. It balances responsiveness with efficiency by intelligently
//! batching pixel updates.
//!
//! # Batching Strategy
//!
//! ## Dual Trigger System
//! Events are batched and sent based on two conditions:
//! - **Capacity Trigger**: Batch sent when buffer reaches maximum size
//! - **Time Trigger**: Batch sent after maximum time interval
//!
//! ## Event Flow Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! CompStage → Individual Events → StageEventBatcher → Batched Events → VizStorage
//!     ↓             ↓                    ↓                  ↓            ↓
//! Parallel    Single Pixel        Async Buffer       Efficient       Sequential
//! Threads     Updates             Management         Batches         Processing
//! ```
//!
//! ## Performance Benefits
//!
//! - **Reduced Channel Overhead**: Fewer async channel operations
//! - **Better Cache Locality**: Related updates processed together
//! - **Controlled Back-pressure**: Prevents overwhelming visualization system
//! - **Responsive UI**: Time-based flushing ensures UI responsiveness
//!
//! # Async Implementation
//!
//! Uses Tokio's `select!` macro to handle multiple async conditions:
//! - **Event Reception**: New events from computation system
//! - **Timer Expiration**: Time-based batch flushing
//! - **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean resource cleanup on completion
//!
//! # Event Types
//!
//! - **ContentChange**: Individual pixel updates (batched)
//! - **ContentMultiChange**: Pre-batched updates (re-batched)
//! - **StateChange**: Computation state transitions (immediate pass-through)
//!
//! The batcher optimizes pixel updates while ensuring state changes are
//! transmitted immediately for accurate progress tracking.
