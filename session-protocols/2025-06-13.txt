> We are in the middle of refactoring the storage layer for parallel access. The code became too complex for my taste. I 
  thought about a wide-ranging rewrite of the storage structure. Please find the 
  `manifestos/manifesto-02-parallel-storage.md` file where I outlined a plan for this restructuring. Please have a read 
  and give me feedback on this plan. Please ask any questions if needed.

● I'll read the manifesto file to understand your proposed storage layer restructuring plan.

● Read(manifestos/manifesto-02-parallel-storage.md)
  ⎿  Read 107 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Your manifesto outlines a thoughtful approach to the parallel storage problem. The plan is well-structured and addresses
   real architectural concerns that arise when moving from single-threaded to multi-threaded fractal computation. Here's
  my feedback:

  Strengths of the Plan

  Clear Problem Identification: You've correctly identified that Rust's ownership model makes concurrent access
  challenging, and that both visualization-during-computation and parallel computation threads need data access.

  Elegant Separation of Concerns: The three-layer approach (computation storage, visualization storage, shared parameters)
   is architecturally sound and follows good separation of concerns.

  Practical Implementation Strategy: The phased approach from Phase I (end-of-computation) to Phase III (real-time events)
   allows incremental development and testing.

  Questions and Considerations

  ComputationStage Concurrency: What specific Rust concurrency primitive are you considering? RwLock<Vec<DataPoint>>,
  Vec<RwLock<DataPoint>>, or Vec<AtomicDataPoint>? Each has different performance characteristics.

  Event Granularity: Why limit to single points and horizontal lines? Would rectangular regions be useful for block-based
  parallel computation algorithms?

  Memory Overhead: In high-resolution scenarios (8K), you'll have both ComputationStorage and VisualizationStorage in
  memory simultaneously. Have you considered the memory implications?

  Event Queue Backpressure: What happens if the visualization thread can't keep up with computation events? Should there
  be a bounded queue or event coalescing?

  Architectural Suggestion

  Consider whether ImageParameters should be truly shared (Arc) or duplicated. If computation parameters could change
  mid-computation (zoom, iteration count), sharing might create synchronization issues.

  The plan is solid and addresses the core challenges well. The phased implementation approach is particularly good for
  maintaining working code throughout the refactoring.

> Thanks for the considerations. Can you describe what you mean by "event coalescing" in the "event queue backpressure" 
  paragraph?

● Event coalescing means combining or merging multiple events that affect the same data before processing them, rather
  than processing each event individually.

  In your fractal computation context, consider this scenario:
  - Computation thread rapidly updates the same pixel multiple times (perhaps refining the calculation)
  - Instead of sending 5 separate "update pixel (100,50)" events to the visualization queue
  - Coalescing would merge them into a single "update pixel (100,50)" event with the final value

  This reduces queue size and processing overhead. For fractal computation, this is particularly relevant because:

  Refinement algorithms might update the same pixel multiple times as they improve accuracy

  Adaptive algorithms might revisit pixels with different iteration counts

  Fast computation might outpace visualization updates, creating a backlog

  Coalescing strategies could include:
  - Spatial coalescing: Merge adjacent pixel updates into rectangular regions
  - Temporal coalescing: Only keep the latest update for each pixel coordinate
  - Batch coalescing: Collect multiple point updates into a single "update region" message

  Since you mentioned each pixel is only computed once and never changes its final value, coalescing might be less
  critical for your use case. However, it could still help if computation threads generate events faster than
  visualization can process them.

> Thanks for the input. I added some answering thoughts into the manifesto file. You might want to reread it and see 
  whether any questions or open points remain at the moment.

● Excellent additions! Your responses address the key concerns very well. The plan is now much more complete and concrete.
   A few remaining observations:

  Remaining Technical Decisions

  Concurrency Primitive: Your instinct toward Vec<RwLock<DataPoint>> is sound - it provides fine-grained locking per
  pixel. Consider the trade-off between lock overhead and contention probability for your use case.

  Boundary Tracing Algorithm: The horizontal line optimization for your future boundary-trace algorithm is clever forward
  planning. This shows good architectural thinking.

  Minor Implementation Details

  Event Queue Bounds: While your memory analysis shows 1.5GB max is reasonable, consider using a bounded queue anyway to
  prevent pathological cases where visualization completely stalls.

  Resynchronization Timing: Your resync strategy is solid. The critical timing requirement you mentioned (start collecting
   events before/during new DataStorage generation) might need careful coordination - perhaps a simple sequence number or
  generation counter?

  Architecture Completeness

  The plan now covers all major aspects:
  - ✅ Concurrency strategy identified
  - ✅ Memory overhead calculated and deemed acceptable
  - ✅ Event granularity justified with future algorithm needs
  - ✅ Backpressure handling through queue size limits
  - ✅ Parameter sharing decision made
  - ✅ Resynchronization strategy defined

  The manifesto has evolved into a comprehensive technical specification. The implementation plan provides a clear path
  forward with measurable milestones. This looks ready for implementation!

> Great. Then let's start with that storage design. `DataPlane` currently has a `data: Vec<Option<DataPoint>>`. The new 
  `ComputationStage` should there have a `data: Vec<RwLock<Option<DataPoint>>`, right? Can you explain what this actually 
  means for concurrent access to elements of `data`?

● Yes, exactly! Vec<RwLock<Option<DataPoint>>> would give you the fine-grained concurrent access you need.

  What This Means for Concurrent Access

  Per-Element Locking: Each DataPoint position has its own independent lock. Thread A can write to pixel (10,5) while
  Thread B simultaneously reads from pixel (50,30) - no blocking between them.

  Read-Write Semantics:
  - Multiple threads can read the same pixel simultaneously (read() lock)
  - Only one thread can write to a pixel at a time (write() lock)
  - Writers block readers for that specific pixel only

  Option Handling: The Option represents computed vs uncomputed state:
  - None = not yet computed
  - Some(DataPoint) = computed with iteration data

  Practical Usage Example

  // Thread 1 computing pixel (x1, y1)
  let index = y1 * width + x1;
  let mut guard = data[index].write().unwrap();
  *guard = Some(DataPoint::new(iterations, final_x, final_y));

  // Thread 2 simultaneously reading pixel (x2, y2) 
  let index = y2 * width + x2;
  let guard = data[index].read().unwrap();
  match *guard {
      Some(ref point) => // use the computed data
      None => // pixel not computed yet
  }

  Key Benefits

  - True Parallelism: Multiple computation threads can work simultaneously
  - Granular Blocking: Lock contention only occurs if threads access the exact same pixel
  - Safe Concurrent Reads: Visualization can read computed pixels while computation continues elsewhere

  This design allows your parallel computation threads to work independently across the image plane while maintaining
  Rust's memory safety guarantees.

> What is the overhead in space and execution time of these RwLocks?

● Space Overhead

  RwLock Size: Each RwLock<T> has significant overhead beyond just storing T:
  - On Linux: ~40-48 bytes per RwLock (includes pthread_rwlock_t + Rust wrapper)
  - Your DataPoint is likely ~24-32 bytes (3 fields: u32 iterations, f64 x, f64 y)
  - So RwLock<Option<DataPoint>> ≈ 70-80 bytes vs ~32 bytes for raw Option<DataPoint>

  Memory Impact: For 8K resolution (67M pixels):
  - Current: ~2.1 GB for raw data
  - With RwLocks: ~5.2 GB for the same data
  - 2.5x memory increase

  Execution Time Overhead

  Lock Acquisition: Each read/write requires system calls:
  - Uncontended locks: ~10-50 nanoseconds overhead
  - Contended locks: Much higher (microseconds, thread scheduling)
  - For fractal computation doing millions of pixel operations, this adds up

  Cache Performance: RwLocks reduce cache efficiency due to larger memory footprint and lock metadata interspersed with
  data.

  Alternative: Coarser Granularity

  Consider RwLock<Vec<Option<DataPoint>>> with manual coordination:
  - Much lower memory overhead (single lock for entire plane)
  - Threads coordinate access patterns (e.g., each thread works on different rows)
  - Still allows concurrent reads during visualization
  - Requires more careful algorithm design but dramatically better memory efficiency

  For your learning project, the per-pixel approach is conceptually cleaner, but the memory overhead is substantial. The
  coarser approach might be more practical for high-resolution images.

> What is an "uncontended" or "contended" lock?

● Uncontended Lock

  A lock is uncontended when no other thread is trying to access it at the same time.

  // Only Thread A wants this pixel right now
  let guard = data[index].read().unwrap();  // Fast - no waiting

  The lock acquisition is just a simple atomic operation or memory write. Very fast (~10-50 nanoseconds).

  Contended Lock

  A lock is contended when multiple threads want to access the same resource simultaneously.

  // Thread A already has the lock
  let guard_a = data[index].write().unwrap();  // Got it first

  // Thread B tries to get the same lock
  let guard_b = data[index].read().unwrap();   // Must wait!

  Thread B must wait until Thread A releases the lock. This involves:
  - Putting Thread B to sleep
  - OS scheduler getting involved
  - Waking Thread B up when lock becomes available
  - Much slower (microseconds or more)

  In Your Fractal Context

  Low Contention: If computation threads work on different regions of the image, locks are mostly uncontended - each
  thread accesses different pixels.

  High Contention: If multiple threads frequently access the same pixels (unlikely in typical fractal algorithms), you'd
  see contention.

  Visualization Reads: When visualization reads pixels during computation, it creates temporary contention on those
  specific pixels being read.

  For fractal computation, contention should be rare since threads typically work on separate image regions, making the
  per-pixel locking approach more viable.

> Yeah. We go for this approach. Now, before I actually start coding: Is it sensible to split the code a bit more into 
  separate - well - "sets"? In Java, these would be packages like "rs.mandel.storage.computation" and 
  "rs.mandel.storage.visualization". How do I organise this in Rust projects?

● Yes, absolutely! Rust has a module system that's perfect for this kind of organization. Here are the common approaches:

  Option 1: Separate Directories (Recommended)

  Create a directory structure like this:

  src/
  ├── main.rs
  ├── storage/
  │   ├── mod.rs              # Declares the storage module
  │   ├── computation/
  │   │   ├── mod.rs          # Declares computation submodule
  │   │   ├── computation_storage.rs
  │   │   └── computation_stage.rs
  │   ├── visualization/
  │   │   ├── mod.rs          # Declares visualization submodule
  │   │   ├── visualization_storage.rs (renamed from data_storage.rs)
  │   │   └── visualization_plane.rs (renamed from data_plane.rs)
  │   └── shared/
  │       ├── mod.rs
  │       ├── data_point.rs
  │       └── image_parameters.rs

  Module Declaration Pattern

  Each mod.rs file declares what's in that module:

  // src/storage/mod.rs
  pub mod computation;
  pub mod visualization;
  pub mod shared;

  // src/storage/computation/mod.rs
  pub mod computation_storage;
  pub mod computation_stage;

  // Re-export commonly used items
  pub use computation_storage::ComputationStorage;
  pub use computation_stage::ComputationStage;

  Usage from Other Modules

  // In your GUI code
  use crate::storage::computation::ComputationStorage;
  use crate::storage::visualization::VisualizationStorage;
  use crate::storage::shared::ImageParameters;

  Option 2: Single Files (Simpler)

  For smaller codebases, you could also do:
  src/
  ├── main.rs
  ├── storage/
  │   ├── mod.rs
  │   ├── computation_storage.rs
  │   ├── visualization_storage.rs
  │   └── shared.rs

  The directory approach gives you better organization as the code grows, which seems appropriate for your refactoring
  plans.

> Yes, great, I go for the directory approach. Are there any code comment structures like Javadoc in Rust?

● Yes! Rust has excellent built-in documentation comments that work similarly to Javadoc.

  Documentation Comment Syntax

  Module/Struct/Function docs: Use /// (triple slash)
  /// Represents a point in the fractal computation with iteration data.
  /// 
  /// Each DataPoint stores the number of iterations before escape,
  /// along with the final coordinates when the computation stopped.
  pub struct DataPoint {
      /// Number of iterations before the point escaped the set
      iterations: u32,
      /// Final x-coordinate when computation stopped
      final_x: f64,
      /// Final y-coordinate when computation stopped  
      final_y: f64,
  }

  /// Creates a new DataPoint with the given computation results.
  /// 
  /// # Arguments
  /// * `iterations` - Number of iterations before escape
  /// * `final_x` - Final x-coordinate
  /// * `final_y` - Final y-coordinate
  /// 
  /// # Examples
  /// ```
  /// let point = DataPoint::new(42, 1.5, -0.8);
  /// assert_eq!(point.iterations(), 42);
  /// ```
  pub fn new(iterations: u32, final_x: f64, final_y: f64) -> Self {
      // ...
  }

  Inner documentation: Use //! for module-level docs
  //! Computation storage layer for parallel fractal generation.

  pub mod computation_storage;

  Generate Documentation

  cargo doc --open

  This generates HTML documentation like Javadoc and opens it in your browser. The docs include your comments, type
  signatures, and even runnable code examples.

  Special Sections

  - # Arguments - Parameter descriptions
  - # Returns - Return value description
  - # Examples - Code examples (these are tested!)
  - # Panics - When the function might panic
  - # Safety - For unsafe code

  Very similar to Javadoc but integrated into the language tooling!

> Regarding the "shared" subfolder of "storage": Is it more usual to put these files into "storage" directly (with 
  "visualization" and "computation" accessing them) or is it idiomatic to put them into their own subfolder?

● Both approaches are used, but putting shared items directly in storage/ is more idiomatic and common in Rust projects.

  Recommended Structure

  src/
  ├── storage/
  │   ├── mod.rs              # Declares submodules + shared items
  │   ├── data_point.rs       # Shared by both computation & visualization
  │   ├── image_parameters.rs # Shared parameters
  │   ├── computation/
  │   │   ├── mod.rs
  │   │   ├── computation_storage.rs
  │   │   └── computation_stage.rs
  │   └── visualization/
  │       ├── mod.rs
  │       ├── visualization_storage.rs
  │       └── visualization_plane.rs

  Why This Is More Idiomatic

  Natural Hierarchy: Shared items are at the natural parent level, not artificially nested deeper.

  Common Rust Pattern: Most Rust projects follow this - look at std::collections::HashMap vs
  std::collections::hash_map::HashMap.

  Simpler Imports:
  use crate::storage::DataPoint;              // Clean
  // vs
  use crate::storage::shared::DataPoint;      // Unnecessarily nested

  Module Declaration:
  // src/storage/mod.rs
  pub mod computation;
  pub mod visualization;

  // Shared items directly in this module
  pub mod data_point;
  pub mod image_parameters;

  // Re-export for convenience
  pub use data_point::DataPoint;
  pub use image_parameters::ImageParameters;

  The shared/ subfolder approach adds an extra layer that doesn't provide much organizational benefit for the relatively
  small number of shared types you'll have.

> In your example for "mod.rs", you use "pub mod" declarations for the subfolders _and_ for the files stored directly in 
  the folder. Additionally you use some "pub use" declarations "for convenience". I don't understand what this all means. 
  Can you explain?

● Great question! Let me break down Rust's module system step by step:

  pub mod Declarations

  pub mod tells Rust "there's a module here, and other code can access it":

  // src/storage/mod.rs
  pub mod computation;        // "computation/" subfolder exists and is public
  pub mod data_point;         // "data_point.rs" file exists and is public

  Without pub, the module would be private (only accessible within the current module).

  What This Creates

  This creates a module hierarchy:
  crate::storage::computation::...
  crate::storage::data_point::DataPoint

  pub use Re-exports

  pub use creates shortcuts - it takes something from deeper in the hierarchy and makes it available at the current level:

  // src/storage/mod.rs
  pub mod data_point;                    // Module exists at storage::data_point
  pub use data_point::DataPoint;         // Also available at storage::DataPoint

  The Difference in Usage

  Without re-export:
  use crate::storage::data_point::DataPoint;  // Long path

  With re-export:
  use crate::storage::DataPoint;              // Short path - more convenient

  Complete Example

  // src/storage/mod.rs
  pub mod computation;
  pub mod data_point;

  // Re-export commonly used items for convenience
  pub use data_point::DataPoint;

  // Now users can import either way:
  // use crate::storage::data_point::DataPoint;  // Direct
  // use crate::storage::DataPoint;              // Via re-export

  Re-exports are optional - they just make the API more user-friendly by providing shorter import paths for commonly used
  items.

> Great explanation. To me it seems that Rust couples files and logical code structures much loser than Java, where a 
  (public) class always must reside in its own source file and packages follow folder hierarchies directly.

● Exactly! You've identified a key difference between Rust and Java's approach to code organization.

  Java's Tight Coupling

  - One public class = one file (enforced)
  - Package structure = directory structure (mandatory)
  - File name = class name (required)

  // Must be in src/com/example/storage/DataPoint.java
  package com.example.storage;
  public class DataPoint { }

  Rust's Flexible Approach

  - Multiple items per file (structs, enums, functions, etc.)
  - Module structure ≠ file structure (configurable)
  - Explicit module declarations (you control the mapping)

  // src/storage/data_point.rs - can contain multiple public items
  pub struct DataPoint { }
  pub enum ComputationState { }
  pub fn create_default() -> DataPoint { }

  // src/storage/mod.rs - you decide what's exposed and how
  pub mod data_point;
  pub use data_point::{DataPoint, ComputationState}; // Pick what to re-export

  Benefits of Rust's Approach

  - Logical grouping: Related small types can live together
  - API design: Control exactly what users see via re-exports
  - Refactoring freedom: Move code between files without changing import paths
  - Flexibility: One large module can span multiple files, or multiple small modules in one file

  This flexibility means you design your module hierarchy based on logical relationships rather than being constrained by
  file system limitations. It's more work to set up initially, but much more powerful for organizing complex codebases.

> Is it true that I can have a non-public subfolder and then make certain of its elements publically available by 
  re-exporting them in `mod.rs` on a higher layer?

● Yes, absolutely! That's one of the powerful features of Rust's module system.

  Example: Private Module with Selective Re-exports

  // src/storage/mod.rs
  mod internal;  // Private module - not accessible from outside storage

  // Selectively re-export only what you want to be public
  pub use internal::DataPoint;
  // Note: internal::PrivateHelper is NOT re-exported, so stays private

  // src/storage/internal/mod.rs (or internal.rs)
  pub struct DataPoint {
      // This is pub within the internal module
  }

  pub struct PrivateHelper {
      // Also pub within internal, but not re-exported
  }

  What This Achieves

  From outside the storage module:
  use crate::storage::DataPoint;        // ✅ Works - re-exported
  use crate::storage::internal::DataPoint;  // ❌ Error - internal is private
  use crate::storage::PrivateHelper;    // ❌ Error - not re-exported

  Real-World Use Case

  This is perfect for implementation details:
  // src/storage/mod.rs
  mod internal_utils;  // Private implementation helpers
  pub mod computation; // Public API
  pub mod visualization; // Public API

  // Re-export selected internals that other modules need
  pub use internal_utils::SharedAlgorithm;
  // But keep internal_utils::ComplexHelper private

  This gives you fine-grained control over your public API - you can have complex internal organization while presenting a
   clean, simple interface to the rest of your codebase. It's like Java's package-private visibility, but more flexible.

> Regarding this "crate" I saw so often now: Is it correct that this is a reference to "this project". So, writing "use 
  some_project::module::submodule" references some external module or library while "crate::storage::DataPoint" references
   whatever _this_ project's "storage" module exports as "DataPoint"?

● Exactly right! You've understood it perfectly.

  crate = This Project

  crate is Rust's keyword for "the current project/library I'm working in":

  use crate::storage::DataPoint;  // MY project's storage module

  External Dependencies

  External libraries use their crate name:

  use iced::Application;          // The "iced" library's Application
  use tokio::sync::mpsc;          // The "tokio" library's mpsc module
  use std::collections::HashMap;  // Standard library's HashMap

  Complete Example

  // In your mandel.rs project
  use crate::storage::DataPoint;           // Your DataPoint
  use crate::computation::ComputationStage; // Your ComputationStage

  use iced::{Application, Command};        // External iced library
  use std::sync::Arc;                      // Standard library

  Other Module References

  There are also:
  - super:: - parent module
  - self:: - current module
  - No prefix - items in the current module

  // If you're in src/storage/computation/mod.rs
  use crate::storage::DataPoint;    // From project root
  use super::DataPoint;             // From parent (storage)
  use self::ComputationStage;       // From current module

  So yes - crate:: always means "starting from the root of THIS project", while bare names like iced:: or std:: refer to
  external dependencies declared in your Cargo.toml.

> I think I understood the main concepts. I was able to move the existing classes into this module and submodule structure
   and fix all "use" statements. It seems to be mandatory that I have a "mod.rs" declaring the exports in each folder 
  representing a module.

✻ Thinking…

  The user has successfully implemented the module structure we discussed and has noticed that mod.rs files are required 
  in each directory that represents a module. This is correct - in Rust, when you have a directory representing a module, 
  you need a mod.rs file in that directory to declare what's in the module and what's exported from it.

  Let me confirm this understanding and maybe clarify a few related points about Rust's module system.

● Exactly! You've grasped the key requirement of Rust's module system.

  mod.rs is the Module Declaration File

  Every directory that represents a module must have a mod.rs file that:
  - Declares what submodules exist (mod computation;)
  - Controls what's publicly accessible (pub mod, pub use)
  - Acts as the "entry point" for that module

  Your Structure Should Look Like:

  src/
  ├── storage/
  │   ├── mod.rs              # Required! Declares computation, visualization, etc.
  │   ├── data_point.rs
  │   ├── image_parameters.rs
  │   ├── computation/
  │   │   ├── mod.rs          # Required! Declares computation_storage, etc.
  │   │   ├── computation_storage.rs
  │   │   └── computation_stage.rs
  │   └── visualization/
  │       ├── mod.rs          # Required! Declares visualization_storage, etc.
  │       ├── visualization_storage.rs
  │       └── visualization_plane.rs

  Why This is Mandatory

  Rust doesn't automatically scan directories like some languages do. You must explicitly tell Rust:
  - "This directory contains a module" (via mod.rs)
  - "These files are part of this module" (via mod filename; in mod.rs)
  - "These items are public" (via pub mod or pub use)

  Alternative: Edition 2018+ Style

  Modern Rust also allows storage.rs instead of storage/mod.rs for the parent module, but the principle remains the same -
   you need explicit declarations.

  Great job getting the module structure working! This foundation will make organizing your parallel storage
  implementation much cleaner.

● CLAUDE.md has been updated with your storage layer refactoring progress and committed successfully! The commit includes:

  - Updated documentation reflecting the modular architecture transition
  - New project structure showing the storage/ directory organization
  - Added Rust concepts covering module systems, concurrent data structures, and memory planning
  - All code changes from your module restructuring work

  The commit shows 9 files changed with your storage layer reorganization - the foundation is now ready for implementing
  the parallel ComputationStorage with RwLock-based concurrent access.

> I will call it a day now. Any last considerations from your side?

● Great progress today! You've successfully laid the architectural foundation for parallel fractal computation. A few
  final thoughts:

  What You've Accomplished

  - Solid Module Architecture: Directory-based organization that cleanly separates concerns
  - Rust Module Mastery: Deep understanding of mod.rs, visibility, and re-exports
  - Concurrency Planning: Thoughtful analysis of RwLock trade-offs and memory overhead
  - Implementation Roadmap: Clear manifesto with phased approach

  Next Session Prep

  When you return, you'll be ready to implement the core concurrent data structures:
  - ComputationStage with Vec<RwLock<Option<DataPoint>>>
  - ComputationStorage wrapper
  - Unit tests for concurrent access patterns

  Key Design Decision Made

  Your choice of per-pixel RwLocks over coarser-grained locking shows good architectural thinking - prioritizing
  correctness and learning over premature optimization.

  The modular foundation you've built will make the parallel implementation much cleaner. You've transformed a
  single-threaded codebase into a well-organized, parallel-ready architecture while mastering advanced Rust concepts.

  Excellent work on both the technical implementation and learning journey!

> Ok, bye!

● Bye! Have a great rest of your day. The storage refactoring foundation looks excellent - you'll be ready to dive into
  the concurrent implementation next time. 👋
