‚óè Perfect! I'm now up to speed with your mandel.rs project. You're working on a Rust fractal visualizer as a learning project, currently in
  manifesto 03 focusing on issue 7 (interactive area selection with panning and zooming).

  I can see that:
  - Panning is already implemented
  - Zooming is waiting for implementation
  - The project uses a dual storage system (CompStorage for computation, VizStorage for visualization)
  - You're using Iced 0.13 for the GUI
  - This is an educational project where you'll type all code yourself

  I'm ready to help guide you through implementing the zooming functionality. Would you like me to help you understand the current codebase
  structure first, or do you have specific questions about how to approach the zooming implementation?

> We will start with the zooming. I want to do this with `mouse::Event::WheelScrolled` events. However, these events do not have a real "end 
  event" so that you know that the user ended the zooming process. How would you implement detecting the end of the zoom operation?

‚óè Great question! The mouse wheel events are indeed discrete events without a clear "end" signal. Here are several approaches to detect when a
  zoom operation sequence has ended:

  Approach 1: Timer-based Detection (Recommended)

  Use a timer that resets with each wheel event. When the timer expires without new wheel events, consider the zoom sequence complete.

  // In your state struct
  zoom_timer: Option<tokio::time::Instant>,
  const ZOOM_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_millis(300); // Adjust as needed

  The logic would be:
  - On each WheelScrolled event: reset the timer and accumulate zoom changes
  - Use iced::time::every() to check periodically if the timeout has passed
  - When timeout expires: finalize the zoom operation and update CompStorage

  Approach 2: Accumulator with Debouncing

  Similar to approach 1, but accumulate multiple wheel events and only apply the final zoom when the sequence ends.

  Approach 3: Immediate + Deferred Pattern

  - Apply zoom immediately to VizStorage for responsive UI
  - Use a timer to batch the final update to CompStorage (preserving computed data)

  Approach 4: State-based Detection

  Track zoom state explicitly:
  enum ZoomState {
      Idle,
      Zooming { accumulated_delta: f32, last_event: Instant },
  }

  Questions to Consider:

  1. Do you want immediate visual feedback (zoom VizStorage immediately) or batch all changes?
  2. How responsive should the zoom feel vs. how much do you want to preserve computed data?
  3. Are you planning to preserve/transform existing CompStorage data during zoom (as mentioned in manifesto 03)?

  Which approach feels most suitable for your learning goals and the user experience you want to create?

> You may want to look at src/gui/iced/fract_canvas.rs . In `fn update()`, I have already implemented panning (or dragging): There, while the 
  dragging operation goes on, the storages are _not_ updated. Only when computing the pixels for the canvas, an additional shift is applied to 
  the data in the VizStorage. Only on finishing the drag, the coordinates for filling CompStorage and VizStorage are updated. With zooming, I 
  want to do it in a similar way: During zoom operation, the unchanged VizStorage data is scaled and translated when the on-screen pixels for the
   canvas are computed. Only when zooming finished, new coordinates for the CompStorage are computed and recomputation of the image begins.

‚óè Read(src/gui/iced/fract_canvas.rs)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 569 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Perfect! I can see the dragging implementation you described. Looking at the code, I can see the pattern:

  1. During drag: drag_shift is stored in CanvasState and applied when drawing (line 452-455)
  2. After drag: When ButtonReleased, the final offset is sent as Message::ShiftStage to update the actual coordinates

  For zooming, you'll want to follow the same pattern. Here's my suggested approach:

  Recommended Structure for Zooming

  1. Extend CanvasState

  Add zoom-related fields similar to the drag fields:
  pub struct CanvasState {
      drag_start: Option<Point>,
      drag_shift: Option<Size>,
      // Add these for zooming:
      zoom_accumulator: f32,  // Accumulate wheel deltas
      zoom_last_event: Option<std::time::Instant>,  // Track last wheel event
  }

  2. Handle WheelScrolled Events

  In the update() method, capture wheel events and update the accumulator:
  mouse::Event::WheelScrolled { delta } => {
      // Update zoom accumulator and timestamp
      // Return (event::Status::Captured, None) - no message yet
  }

  3. Timer-based Zoom Completion Detection

  Use Iced's iced::time::every() subscription to periodically check if zooming has finished:
  - If zoom_last_event is older than ~300ms, send a Message::ZoomStage message
  - This mirrors your Message::ShiftStage pattern

  4. Apply Zoom During Drawing

  In the draw() method, when creating the ImageInCanvas, apply zoom scaling similar to how you apply drag_shift to the pixels.

  Key Questions for Your Implementation:

  1. Zoom center: Should zoom center around the mouse position or the image center?
  2. Zoom factor: How much should each wheel "tick" zoom? (e.g., 1.1x per tick)
  3. Zoom limits: Should there be min/max zoom levels?
  4. Coordinate preservation: How will you transform existing CompStorage coordinates when zoom finishes?

  The timer approach fits well with Iced's message-driven architecture and matches your existing drag pattern. Would you like me to elaborate on
  any of these aspects?

> I think I will do most of the implementation myself. For the zoom factor, I thought about the formula "2^(0.1*wheelticks)". This brings every 
  ten ticks a power of two which allows to reuse some of the computed points for the new image. This could lead to extreme factors with longer 
  zoom operations but that's ok I think. The zoom center will be around the mouse position.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user wants to implement most of the zooming functionality themselves, which is perfect given the educational nature of the project 
  mentioned in CLAUDE.md. They're asking for my thoughts on their zoom factor formula and approach.

  Let me think about their formula: 2^(0.1*wheelticks)

  This is a clever choice! Here's why:
  - Every 10 wheel ticks = 2^1 = 2x zoom
  - Every 20 wheel ticks = 2^2 = 4x zoom  
  - Every 30 wheel ticks = 2^3 = 8x zoom

  This means at powers of 2, they can potentially reuse computed data by:
  - 2x zoom: every other pixel can be reused
  - 4x zoom: every 4th pixel can be reused
  - 8x zoom: every 8th pixel can be reused

  The mouse position as zoom center is also a good UX choice - it's what users expect from most graphics applications.

  The extreme factors with longer zoom operations is indeed a consideration, but for a fractal explorer, extreme zoom levels are actually 
  desirable since fractals have infinite detail.

  I should keep my response concise and focus on validating their approach rather than giving implementation details, since they want to do it 
  themselves.

‚óè Excellent choice! The 2^(0.1*wheelticks) formula is very clever for several reasons:

  Power-of-2 Optimization: Every 10 ticks gives you clean 2x, 4x, 8x zoom factors where you can efficiently reuse computed pixels:
  - 2x zoom: reuse every other pixel
  - 4x zoom: reuse every 4th pixel
  - 8x zoom: reuse every 8th pixel

  Smooth Progression: The 0.1 exponent gives smooth zoom steps (~1.07x per tick) that feel natural.

  Fractal-Friendly: Extreme zoom factors are actually desirable for fractals since they have infinite detail to explore.

  Mouse-centered zoom is perfect UX - it's what users expect from graphics applications.

  One small consideration: You might want to clamp the wheel delta to prevent massive jumps if someone spins their wheel very aggressively, but
  that's a minor detail.

  Your approach aligns perfectly with the existing drag pattern and should integrate cleanly with the CompStorage/VizStorage system. The
  power-of-2 optimization will be especially valuable for maintaining performance during deep zooms.

  Good luck with the implementation! The mathematical elegance of your zoom formula should make the coordinate transformations quite clean.

> I already investigated a bit and found that the values of the WheelScrolled events are weird. I think I will only use their sign and - apart 
  from that - simply count the ticks.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user is saying that the WheelScrolled event values are weird and they want to just use the sign and count ticks. This makes sense - wheel 
  scroll events can have different delta values depending on the device, OS, and scroll settings. Some mice report precise values, others report 
  large jumps, and trackpads can report continuous small values. By just using the sign and counting discrete ticks, they get consistent behavior
   regardless of the input device.

  This is a common approach in applications that need predictable zoom behavior - ignore the magnitude and just treat each wheel event as +1 or 
  -1 tick.

‚óè Smart decision! Wheel scroll deltas are indeed inconsistent across devices and platforms:

  - Mice: Often report discrete values like ¬±120 or ¬±1
  - Trackpads: Can report continuous fractional values
  - Different OS: Scale values differently
  - Scroll settings: User preferences affect magnitudes

  By using just the sign and counting discrete ticks, you get:
  - Consistent behavior across all input devices
  - Predictable zoom steps regardless of hardware
  - Clean integer math for your 2^(0.1*tick_count) formula

  This approach is used by many professional graphics applications for exactly this reason. Each wheel "event" becomes exactly one tick in your
  accumulator, making the zoom feel uniform whether someone uses a mouse wheel, trackpad, or other input device.

  Your formula becomes beautifully simple:
  let zoom_factor = 2.0_f32.powf(0.1 * tick_count as f32);

  Where tick_count is just the sum of +1 or -1 for each wheel event. Much cleaner than trying to interpret arbitrary delta values!

> In src/gui/iced/fract_canvas.rs::584, I try to access the content of the ScrollDelta event payload. However, I do not get the syntax right. Can
   you guide me?

‚óè Looking at your code on line 563, you're trying to access delta.Lines but the syntax is incorrect. The ScrollDelta is an enum, so you need to
  match on its variants.

  Here's the correct syntax:

  mouse::Event::WheelScrolled { delta } => {
      if state.operation == CanvasOperation::Idle {
          let tick_direction = match delta {
              mouse::ScrollDelta::Lines { y, .. } => {
                  if y.abs() > 1e-5 {
                      Some(if y > 0.0 { 1 } else { -1 })
                  } else {
                      None
                  }
              }
              mouse::ScrollDelta::Pixels { y, .. } => {
                  if y.abs() > 1e-5 {
                      Some(if y > 0.0 { 1 } else { -1 })
                  } else {
                      None
                  }
              }
          };

          if let Some(tick) = tick_direction
              && let Some(position) = cursor.position()
              && let Some(point) = ImageInCanvas::for_app_state_and_bounds(&self.app_state, bounds)
                  .map(|iic| iic.mouse_to_image_if_valid(position))
          {
              // Your zoom logic here
          }
      }
      // rest of your logic...
  }

  The ScrollDelta enum has two variants:
  - Lines { x: f32, y: f32 } - for discrete scroll events
  - Pixels { x: f32, y: f32 } - for continuous scroll events

  Both give you the same tick direction (+1 or -1) regardless of the actual values.

> I have now implemented the scroll wheel evaluation in src/gui/iced/fract_canvas.rs from line 593 on. However, this timer thing is still 
  missing. What's the pattern here?

‚óè For the timer pattern in Iced, you need to set up a subscription that periodically checks if the zoom timeout has expired. Here's the pattern:

  1. Add Timer Support to Your App

  In your main app file (likely src/gui/iced/app.rs), you'll need to add a subscription method:

  impl Application for YourApp {
      // ... existing methods ...

      fn subscription(&self) -> Subscription<Message> {
          // Check for zoom timeout every 100ms
          iced::time::every(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100))
              .map(|_| Message::CheckZoomTimeout)
      }
  }

  2. Add the Timer Message

  In your Message enum (likely src/gui/iced/message.rs), add:

  pub enum Message {
      // ... existing messages ...
      CheckZoomTimeout,
      ZoomStage(/* zoom parameters */),
  }

  3. Handle the Timer in Your Update Logic

  In your main app's update() method:

  fn update(&mut self, message: Message) -> Command<Message> {
      match message {
          Message::CheckZoomTimeout => {
              // Check if canvas is in zoom mode and timeout has expired
              if let Some(canvas_state) = &self.canvas_state {
                  if canvas_state.operation == CanvasOperation::Zoom {
                      if let Some(last_tick) = canvas_state.zoom_last_tick {
                          if last_tick.elapsed() > Duration::from_millis(300) {
                              // Zoom timeout - finalize zoom
                              return Command::perform(
                                  async { /* zoom parameters */ },
                                  Message::ZoomStage
                              );
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
              Command::none()
          }
          Message::ZoomStage(/* params */) => {
              // Reset canvas state and update coordinates
              // Similar to your ShiftStage handling
              Command::none()
          }
          // ... other messages
      }
  }

  The key insight is that Iced uses subscriptions for time-based events, not timers within the canvas itself. The subscription runs globally and
  sends messages when conditions are met.

> But I do not have access to the CanvasState from the app's update() method.

‚óè You're absolutely right! The CanvasState is internal to the canvas widget and not accessible from the app's update() method.

  Here are the proper patterns for this situation:

  Option 1: Move Zoom State to App State (Recommended)

  Move the zoom tracking out of CanvasState and into your main AppState:

  // In your AppState
  pub struct AppState {
      // ... existing fields ...
      pub zoom_operation: Option<ZoomOperation>,
  }

  pub struct ZoomOperation {
      pub tick_sum: i32,
      pub last_tick: Instant,
      pub center_point: Point, // Mouse position where zoom started
  }

  Then in your canvas update() method, return messages immediately:
  mouse::Event::WheelScrolled { delta } => {
      if let Some(position) = cursor.position() {
          let tick = Self::mouse_wheel_to_zoom_tick(delta);
          if tick != 0 {
              return (event::Status::Captured, Some(Message::ZoomTick { tick, position }));
          }
      }
      (event::Status::Ignored, None)
  }

  Option 2: Timer Events from Canvas

  Add a timer event to your canvas that fires periodically:

  // In your canvas update method
  Event::Timer => {
      if state.operation == CanvasOperation::Zoom {
          if let Some(last_tick) = state.zoom_last_tick {
              if last_tick.elapsed() > Duration::from_millis(300) {
                  // Zoom finished - send final message
                  let final_message = Message::ZoomFinished {
                      tick_sum: state.zoom_tick_sum,
                      center: state.start_pixel.unwrap(),
                  };
                  state.operation = CanvasOperation::Idle;
                  state.zoom_tick_sum = 0;
                  state.zoom_last_tick = None;
                  return (event::Status::Captured, Some(final_message));
              }
          }
      }
      (event::Status::Ignored, None)
  }

  Option 1 is cleaner because it keeps the zoom logic in your app state where the subscription can access it. Which approach feels better for
  your architecture?

> I find it much cleaner to keep the ongoing zoom in the canvas and not in the app's global state. How is this "Event::Timer" triggered?

‚óè You're right that keeping zoom state in the canvas is cleaner! However, I need to clarify - there isn't a built-in Event::Timer in Iced's
  canvas events.

  Here are the actual options for timer-based events in canvas:

  Option 1: Request Redraw to Trigger Timer Check

  Use request_redraw() to periodically check timeout in the draw() method:

  fn draw(&self, state: &Self::State, ...) -> Vec<Geometry> {
      // Check zoom timeout during draw
      if state.operation == CanvasOperation::Zoom {
          if let Some(last_tick) = state.zoom_last_tick {
              if last_tick.elapsed() > Duration::from_millis(300) {
                  // Send zoom finished message somehow...
                  // This is tricky because draw() can't return messages
              }
          }
      }
      // ... rest of draw logic
  }

  Option 2: Custom Timer via App Subscription (Recommended)

  Keep zoom state in canvas, but use app subscription to periodically send a "check timeout" message to the canvas:

  // In canvas update():
  Event::Custom(custom_event) => {
      if let CustomEvent::CheckZoomTimeout = custom_event {
          if state.operation == CanvasOperation::Zoom {
              if let Some(last_tick) = state.zoom_last_tick {
                  if last_tick.elapsed() > Duration::from_millis(300) {
                      // Reset state and send zoom finished message
                      state.operation = CanvasOperation::Idle;
                      return (event::Status::Captured, Some(Message::ZoomFinished { ... }));
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      (event::Status::Ignored, None)
  }

  But honestly, Option 2 from my previous response (moving zoom state to app level) is the most idiomatic Iced pattern. Canvas widgets are
  typically for rendering and immediate interaction, while ongoing operations usually live in app state.

  Which direction would you prefer to explore?

> How do I send the custom "check timeout" event from the app subscription to the canvas?

‚óè You can't directly send custom events to a canvas widget from subscriptions. Iced's canvas only receives predefined events like mouse,
  keyboard, and window events.

  Here are the actual working patterns:

  Option 1: Canvas Requests Own Updates

  The canvas can request periodic redraws and check timeout during draw:

  impl<'a> canvas::Program<Message> for FractalCanvas<'a> {
      fn draw(&self, state: &Self::State, renderer: &Renderer, ...) -> Vec<Geometry> {
          // Check timeout during draw
          if state.operation == CanvasOperation::Zoom {
              if let Some(last_tick) = state.zoom_last_tick {
                  if last_tick.elapsed() > Duration::from_millis(300) {
                      // Need to modify state and send message - but draw() is immutable!
                      // This won't work cleanly
                  }
              }
          }
          // ... draw logic
      }
  }

  Option 2: App Polls Canvas State

  The app subscription checks a shared state:

  // In your AppState
  pub struct AppState {
      pub canvas_zoom_state: Option<ZoomState>, // Shared between app and canvas
  }

  // Canvas updates this shared state
  // App subscription checks this shared state

  Option 3: Immediate Messages (Simplest)

  Skip the timeout entirely - send zoom messages immediately and let the app handle batching:

  // In canvas, send message for each wheel event
  mouse::Event::WheelScrolled { delta } => {
      let tick = Self::mouse_wheel_to_zoom_tick(delta);
      if tick != 0 {
          return (event::Status::Captured, Some(Message::ZoomTick { tick, mouse_pos }));
      }
  }

  // In app, use a timer to batch zoom operations

  Option 3 is most common in Iced applications. The canvas sends immediate messages, and the app handles the timing logic. Would you like to
  explore this approach?

       26 -  using some randomisation of the computed points.

       26 -  Visualization is an interface implemented using Iced 0.13. It allows to enter all data for computation
       27 -  and controls the computation engine. Currently it allows to drag the computed image and update the computation.
       26 +  **Visualization Interface**: Iced 0.13-based GUI providing computation controls and interactive fractal rendering. Features 
     implemented:
          + implemented:
       27 +  - ‚úÖ **Panning**: Interactive dragging with deferred coordinate updates
       28 +  - üöß **Zooming**: Partial implementation with mouse wheel events and `2^(0.1*ticks)` scaling formula
       29    
       30 +  ### Interactive Controls Architecture
       31 +  The canvas uses a state-based operation system:
       32 +  - `CanvasOperation::Idle` - Default state, ready for new interactions
       33 +  - `CanvasOperation::Drag` - Active panning with visual feedback
       34 +  - `CanvasOperation::Zoom` - Accumulating zoom operations (in progress)
       35 +  
       36 +  During operations, visual transformations are applied to VizStorage data without recomputation. Only when operations complete are 
     new
          +  coordinates calculated for CompStorage, triggering fresh fractal computation.
