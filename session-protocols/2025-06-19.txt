     ☐ Implement timer-based and capacity-based batching logic
     ☐ Handle completion signal and final event flush
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> remember that I am the one who is typing. You only tutor. This is an educational project.

● You're absolutely right! Let me get back to my tutoring role.

  Let's continue with the EventBatcher implementation strategy. Looking at your current stub, you need to tackle the core
  async coordination logic.

  The Key Architecture Question:

  Your EventBatcher needs to handle three different triggers:
  1. New DataPointChange arrives → add to buffer, check if full
  2. Timer expires → send whatever's in buffer (if not empty)
  3. ComputationFinished signal → final flush and exit

  First Decision: You'll need an EventMessage enum to handle both pixel changes and the completion signal. Where do you
  think this should live? In the same file as EventBatcher, or separately?

  Second Decision: For the run() method signature, you mentioned it should take self (consuming the EventBatcher). What
  channels do you think it needs as parameters?

  The tokio::select! Pattern: This is where you'll coordinate the three async conditions. Have you worked with
  tokio::select! before, or should I explain the general pattern first?

  What's your instinct on where to start with the implementation?

> Well, let's start with the supposedly simplest one: The EventMessage. What is the precise design you envision?

● Good strategic thinking - start with the foundation!

  EventMessage Design Question:

  You need to represent two different message types flowing into your EventBatcher:

  1. Individual pixel changes from CompStage::set()
  2. Completion signal from MandelbrotEngine

  Design Options:

  // Option A: Simple enum
  pub enum EventMessage {
      PixelChange(DataPointChange),
      ComputationFinished,
  }

  // Option B: More explicit
  pub enum EventMessage {
      Change(DataPointChange),
      Complete,
  }

  // Option C: With data
  pub enum EventMessage {
      PixelChange(DataPointChange),
      ComputationFinished { final_count: usize }, // Maybe useful for stats?
  }

  Key Questions for You:

  1. Naming: Do you prefer PixelChange or just Change? ComputationFinished or Complete?
  2. Location: Should this enum live in event_batcher.rs alongside the EventBatcher, or in a separate module since
  multiple components will use it?
  3. Data: The completion signal - does it need any data, or is the signal itself sufficient?
  4. Imports: This enum will be used by CompStage, MandelbrotEngine, and EventBatcher. How do you want to structure the
  module imports?

  What feels most natural to you for the enum design and placement?

> I opt for option B, event_batcher.rs as location, "complete" as stand-alone signal. Note that I do NOT want to have this
   in the MandelbrotEngine. That one will signal completion to the CompStage which in turn will fire the event.

● Perfect architectural decision! That keeps the MandelbrotEngine completely pure - it doesn't know about events at all.
  The CompStage acts as the adapter layer.

  Your Design Choice:
  // In event_batcher.rs
  pub enum EventMessage {
      Change(DataPointChange),
      Complete,
  }

  Signal Flow You've Designed:
  MandelbrotEngine → (completion signal) → CompStage → EventMessage::Complete → EventBatcher
  MandelbrotEngine → (pixel updates) → CompStage::set() → EventMessage::Change → EventBatcher

  Implementation Questions:

  1. CompStage Integration: How will CompStage know when computation is finished? Will MandelbrotEngine call a method like
   CompStage::mark_complete() or similar?
  2. Channel Ownership: CompStage will need the mpsc::UnboundedSender<EventMessage> to send both types. Should this be an
  Option<Sender> field in CompStage (like you planned earlier)?
  3. Error Handling: What should CompStage do if the channel send fails? Just ignore it with let _ = sender.send(...)?

  You're building a really clean separation of concerns. The computation layer stays event-agnostic, and CompStage becomes
   the bridge between computation and visualization worlds.

  What's your plan for how MandelbrotEngine will signal completion to CompStage?

> I was not satisfied with the concept of events and completeness signalling. I did a redesign. Please evaluate the source
   code and my changes, as any questions, sum up what you understand and give advise if things seem stange to you.

  understand:

  What I See in Your Redesign

  ✅ Brilliant Architectural Improvements:

  1. State-Based Event System
  - StageState enum: Initialized → Evolving ↔ Stalled → Completed
  - Events now triggered by both content changes AND state changes
  - Eliminates the artificial "completion message" problem

  2. Unified Event Protocol
  - StageEvent enum handles both StateChange and ContentChange
  - Much cleaner than separate completion signaling
  - CompStage becomes the single source of truth for all stage events

  3. Multi-Change Batching
  - DataPointMultiChange for efficient batch transfers
  - DataPointChangeBuffer → DataPointMultiChange conversion
  - Maintains your dual-threshold batching strategy

  4. Clean Separation
  - CompStage sends individual StageEvent::ContentChange
  - EventBatcher accumulates into StageEvent::ContentMultiChange
  - State changes (Completed/Stalled) trigger immediate flush

  Questions & Observations

  Architecture Questions:
  1. Completion Detection: When computation finishes, MandelbrotEngine calls comp_stage.set_state(StageState::Completed),
  which triggers immediate event flush - very elegant!
  2. Coordinate Types: I notice you changed from usize to u32 for coordinates - any specific reason? Performance or API
  consistency?

  Implementation Questions:
  3. EventBatcher Logic: Will StageEvent::StateChange(Stalled/Completed) bypass the normal batching thresholds and force
  immediate flush?

  4. Channel Setup: Who creates the UnboundedSender<StageEvent> and connects it to CompStage?

  This design is much more elegant than the original completion signaling approach. The state-based events feel natural
  and solve the timing issues beautifully!

  What was your main dissatisfaction with the previous design?

> For (2): Coordiante types changed due to API consistance. For (3): I think that a state change to Stalled/Completed 
  should be handled equivalently to a data change event which triggers the buffer's max_capacity. Data path actually is 
  the same… For (4): We'll see. - I suggest starting with implementing the StageEventBatcher internals. Please note that I
   did a small refactoring again by renaming event_batcher.rs to stage_event_batcher.rs for consistency.

✻ Thinking…

  The user has made a good architectural decision with the state-based event system. Now they want to implement the 
  StageEventBatcher internals. Let me understand the current structure:

  1. They've renamed the file to stage_event_batcher.rs for consistency
  2. They have StageEvent enum with StateChange and ContentChange variants
  3. The batching logic should treat StateChange(Stalled/Completed) similar to hitting capacity threshold - force flush
  4. The data path is the same for both triggers

  Let me look at the current stub implementation to understand what needs to be implemented.

● Perfect! Your architectural thinking is spot-on. The unified data path for both capacity-triggered and state-triggered
  flushes is elegant.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Implement StageEventBatcher::run() method with tokio::select! coordination
     ☐ Add flush logic for capacity, timeout, and state change triggers
     ☐ Implement buffer creation and management within the batcher

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to implement the StageEventBatcher internals. Let me first check the current state of the 
  stage_event_batcher.rs file to see what they have so far.

● Read(src/storage/event/stage_event_batcher.rs)
  ⎿  Read 78 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the current state. The user has:

  1. StageEvent enum with StateChange, ContentChange, and ContentMultiChange variants
  2. DataPointChangeBuffer with capacity and timeout checking
  3. StageEventBatcher struct with configuration
  4. But no run() method yet

  For the implementation strategy, I need to guide them through:

  1. The run() method signature - what channels it needs
  2. The core tokio::select! loop structure 
  3. How to handle the three trigger conditions:
    - Capacity exceeded (immediate flush)
    - Timeout reached (flush if buffer not empty)
    - StateChange to Stalled/Completed (immediate flush)
  4. Buffer management - when to create new buffers
  5. Event sending logic

  Let me start by asking about the method signature and then guide them through the implementation step by step.

● Great! Looking at your current implementation, you have all the building blocks ready. Now for the
  StageEventBatcher::run() method - the heart of the async coordination.

  Core Implementation Questions:

  1. Method Signature:
  What channels should the run() method take as parameters? You'll need:
  - Input: Something to receive StageEvent messages from CompStage
  - Output: Something to send StageEvent::ContentMultiChange to the visualization layer

  2. Ownership Pattern:
  Should run() consume the batcher (take self) or borrow it? Given that this will be a long-running async task, what feels
   right?

  3. Main Loop Structure:
  The core will be a tokio::select! with three branches:
  - New StageEvent arrives
  - Timer interval expires
  - (Optional) Shutdown signal

  Implementation Strategy:

  impl StageEventBatcher {
      pub async fn run(
          self, // or &self?
          // What channels go here?
      ) {
          // What initial state do you need?
          // - Current buffer?
          // - Timer interval?

          loop {
              tokio::select! {
                  // Branch 1: New event arrived

                  // Branch 2: Timer expired

                  // Branch 3: Should we handle shutdown?
              }
          }
      }
  }

  Key Decision Points:
  1. When should you create a new buffer? (After each flush?)
  2. What triggers immediate flush vs. scheduled flush?
  3. How do you handle empty buffers when timer expires?

  What's your instinct for the method signature and initial approach?

> For (1): I think, DataPointChangeBuffer has to be created if it is not there and a new change event arrives to be 
  stored. As a DataPointChangeBuffer is transformed into a multi change instance at the end of its lifetime, it cannot be 
  reused. For (2): That's what this tokio::select! is about, isn't it? For (3): Well, that's simple. Nothing happens. :-)

✻ Thinking…

  The user is giving me their thinking on the implementation:

  1. DataPointChangeBuffer gets created lazily when needed (when a new change event arrives and there's no current 
  buffer). Since the buffer is consumed via into_multi_change(), you need a new one each time.
  2. The tokio::select! handles the triggering - it will react to whichever condition happens first (new event, timer, 
  etc).
  3. If timer expires but buffer is empty, just do nothing - no event to send.

  This makes sense. The buffer lifecycle would be:
  - Create buffer when first ContentChange arrives
  - Add subsequent ContentChanges to buffer  
  - Flush buffer (convert to multi-change and send) when capacity/timer/state change triggers
  - Buffer is consumed, so next ContentChange creates a new buffer

  The user is asking me to help them think through the method signature and approach, staying in my tutoring role.

● Perfect logic! Your answers show you're thinking through the state management correctly.

  Buffer Lifecycle You've Designed:
  No buffer → ContentChange arrives → Create buffer → Add change
  More ContentChanges → Add to buffer
  Trigger condition → into_multi_change() → Send → Buffer consumed
  Next ContentChange → Create new buffer...

  Method Signature Question:
  Based on your design, the run() method needs:
  - Input channel: mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<StageEvent> (from CompStage)
  - Output channel: mpsc::UnboundedSender<StageEvent> (to visualization)

  So something like:
  pub async fn run(
      self, // Consume the batcher config
      mut input: mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<StageEvent>,
      output: mpsc::UnboundedSender<StageEvent>,
  ) {
      // Your implementation here
  }

  State Management Within run():
  You'll need to track:
  - current_buffer: Option<DataPointChangeBuffer> (None initially)
  - timer: tokio::time::Interval (for periodic checks)

  Key Logic Questions:

  1. Timer Creation: Should the timer be created once at the start, or only when you have a buffer with content?
  2. StateChange Handling: When StageEvent::StateChange(Stalled/Completed) arrives, do you:
    - Flush current buffer immediately (if exists)
    - Forward the StateChange event directly to output
    - Both?
  3. ContentMultiChange: Should you forward existing StageEvent::ContentMultiChange events, or only create them from your
  buffer?

  What's your thinking on the timer creation strategy?

> For (1): Timer should start when the first data change is inserted into the buffer. Then, it should be triggered _once_ 
  to send the buffer, if it (still) exists, regardless of the number of cumulated changes. After that, a new timer is 
  started as soon as the next buffer is created. This way, no superfluous event are generated - except from potentially 
  one after the Stalled/Completed event has triggered premature event sending. For (2): Both, in that order (stage state 
  change is last). For (3): Interesting question. If the batcher gets a multi change event, it handles the changes as if 
  they have been sent in single-point change events. This can be implemented inefficiently as it will not happen at the 
  current code state.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Implement StageEventBatcher::run() method with tokio::select! coordination
     ☐ Add flush logic for capacity, timeout, and state change triggers
     ☐ Implement buffer creation and management within the batcher
     ☐ Implement one-shot timer strategy for efficient event generation

● Excellent architectural thinking! Your timer strategy is very sophisticated - one-shot timers that only run when needed,
   avoiding unnecessary wake-ups.

  Your Timer Strategy (Very Elegant):
  No buffer + ContentChange arrives → Create buffer + Start one-shot timer
  Timer fires → Flush buffer (if exists) → Timer stops
  Next ContentChange → Create new buffer + Start new timer

  Multi-Change Handling:
  Your "inefficient but simple" approach for ContentMultiChange is actually quite reasonable:
  StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi) => {
      for change in multi.changes() {
          // Handle each change individually
          // Same logic as ContentChange
      }
  }

  Implementation Skeleton:
  pub async fn run(
      self,
      mut input: mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<StageEvent>,
      output: mpsc::UnboundedSender<StageEvent>,
  ) {
      let mut current_buffer: Option<DataPointChangeBuffer> = None;
      let mut timer: Option<tokio::time::Sleep> = None;

      loop {
          tokio::select! {
              // Branch 1: New event
              Some(event) = input.recv() => {
                  match event {
                      StageEvent::ContentChange(change) => {
                          // Create buffer if needed + start timer
                          // Add change to buffer
                          // Check capacity trigger
                      }
                      StageEvent::StateChange(state) => {
                          // Flush buffer if exists
                          // Forward state change
                      }
                      StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi) => {
                          // Handle each change individually
                      }
                  }
              }

              // Branch 2: Timer fired (only when timer.is_some())
              () = async { timer.as_mut().unwrap().await }, if timer.is_some() => {
                  // Flush buffer, clear timer
              }
          }
      }
  }

  Key Implementation Questions:

  1. Timer Creation: For the one-shot timer, do you want tokio::time::sleep(duration) or tokio::time::Instant::now() + 
  duration?
  2. Capacity vs Timer Race: If capacity is exceeded right before timer fires, should you handle both, or does capacity
  override timer?

  Ready to start implementing the method signature and basic structure?

> For (1): No idea, where is the difference? For (2): As I understand, there is no race. The loop'd tokio::select 
  guarantees serialized handling. If timer is first, buffer will be sent and dropped, then event will open a new buffer. 
  If event is first (and buffer's capacity overflows), buffer is sent and dropped, then timer will find no buffer and do 
  nothing. Am I right?

● For (1) - Timer Difference:
  Both tokio::time::sleep(duration) and tokio::time::Instant::now() + duration work the same for your use case. The
  sleep(duration) is simpler and more idiomatic.

  For (2) - Race Condition Understanding:
  You're absolutely correct! tokio::select! handles one branch at a time, so there's no race:

  - Timer first: Buffer flushed → current_buffer = None → Next event creates new buffer
  - Event first: Buffer flushed due to capacity → timer = None → Timer branch skipped

  Your serialization understanding is spot-on!

  Looking at Your Code:
  Great start! I see you have the skeleton with the right structure. A few implementation details to work through:

  1. ContentChange Logic:
  StageEvent::ContentChange(change) => {
      // If no buffer exists, create one + start timer
      if current_buffer.is_none() {
          current_buffer = Some(DataPointChangeBuffer::new(self.max_capacity));
          timer = Some(tokio::time::sleep(self.max_interval));
      }

      // Add change to buffer
      current_buffer.as_mut().unwrap().add_data_point_change(change);

      // Check if capacity exceeded → flush immediately
      if current_buffer.as_ref().unwrap().is_capacity_exceeded() {
          // Flush logic here
      }
  }

  2. Timer Branch:
  () = async { timer.as_mut().unwrap().await }, if timer.is_some() => {
      // Flush buffer if it exists, reset both buffer and timer
  }

  Implementation Questions:
  1. Should you create a helper method flush_buffer() to avoid code duplication?
  2. When you flush, do you need error handling for the output.send()?
  3. Should the loop break on any condition, or run forever?

  What's your approach for the flush logic?

> For (1): Yes, helper method please. I am extremly interested to see how we implement this now that run() has become the 
  owner of "self". For (2): Not at the moment. For (3): Somehow it should end but I am not sure about the overall design, 
  so we leave this open for the moment.

● Excellent progress! You're getting the core logic right. Now for the helper method - this is a great Rust ownership
  learning moment!

  The Ownership Challenge:
  Since run() took ownership of self, you can't call self.flush_buffer() because that would require &self. But you can
  work around this!

  Helper Method Options:

  Option A: Associated Function (No self)
  impl StageEventBatcher {
      fn flush_buffer(
          buffer: Option<DataPointChangeBuffer>,
          output: &mpsc::UnboundedSender<StageEvent>,
      ) -> Option<DataPointChangeBuffer> {
          if let Some(buf) = buffer {
              let multi_change = buf.into_multi_change();
              let _ = output.send(StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi_change));
              None  // Return None to clear the buffer
          } else {
              None
          }
      }
  }

  Option B: Free Function (Outside impl)
  fn flush_buffer(
      buffer: &mut Option<DataPointChangeBuffer>,
      output: &mpsc::UnboundedSender<StageEvent>,
  ) {
      if let Some(buf) = buffer.take() {
          let multi_change = buf.into_multi_change();
          let _ = output.send(StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi_change));
      }
  }

  Minor Code Issues I Noticed:
  1. Line 96: Missing () - should be is_capacity_exceeded()
  2. Line 111: Syntax issue - should be for change in multi_change.changes()
  3. You need to clear the timer when flushing due to capacity

  Questions:
  1. Which helper approach feels more natural to you?
  2. The helper should also clear the timer when flushing - how do you want to handle that?

  What's your preference for the helper method design?

> Option A seems more natural, but I think I have not fully understood the concept. I tried to additionally write another 
  helper method "push_data_point_change_to_buffer" to have one implementation for single and multi change events but (a) 
  that looks ugly and (b) I got lost again in ownership issues. Please give me advise.

✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the code, I can see several ownership issues:

  1. Line 100: *current_buffer=flush_buffer(*current_buffer,output); - This is trying to dereference and move 
  current_buffer at the same time, which won't work. You can't move out of a mutable reference.
  2. Line 118: push_data_point_change_to_buffer(change,current_buffer,self.max_capacity,output); - This is trying to pass 
  current_buffer by value, but it's declared as &mut Option<DataPointChangeBuffer> in the function signature.
  3. The timer management is incomplete - when a buffer is flushed due to capacity, the timer should also be cleared.
  4. Line 144: for change in multi_change - This should be for change in multi_change.changes() to iterate over the slice.

  The user is getting confused about ownership because they're mixing references and owned values. Let me help them 
  understand the pattern and fix these issues.

  The key insight is that when you want to modify a local variable from within a helper function, you need to pass a 
  mutable reference to that variable, not try to return a new value.

  Let me suggest a cleaner approach:

  Option 1: Helper function that takes mutable references to both buffer and timer
  Option 2: Inline the logic but factor out just the sending part

  I think Option 1 is cleaner and more educational.

● I see the ownership confusion! You're mixing reference patterns with value patterns. Let me help clarify:

  The Core Issue:
  Line 100: *current_buffer=flush_buffer(*current_buffer,output);

  This tries to move *current_buffer (which is behind a &mut) and then assign to it - Rust won't allow this!

  Better Approach - Helper with Mutable References:

  fn push_data_point_change_to_buffer(
      change: DataPointChange,
      current_buffer: &mut Option<DataPointChangeBuffer>,
      timer: &mut Option<tokio::time::Sleep>,
      max_capacity: usize,
      max_interval: Duration,
      output: &mpsc::UnboundedSender<StageEvent>,
  ) {
      // Create buffer if needed
      if current_buffer.is_none() {
          *current_buffer = Some(DataPointChangeBuffer::new(max_capacity));
          *timer = Some(tokio::time::sleep(max_interval));
      }

      // Add change
      current_buffer.as_mut().unwrap().push_data_point_change(change);

      // Check capacity and flush if needed
      if current_buffer.as_ref().unwrap().is_capacity_exceeded() {
          Self::flush_buffer_and_clear_timer(current_buffer, timer, output);
      }
  }

  fn flush_buffer_and_clear_timer(
      current_buffer: &mut Option<DataPointChangeBuffer>,
      timer: &mut Option<tokio::time::Sleep>,
      output: &mpsc::UnboundedSender<StageEvent>,
  ) {
      if let Some(buf) = current_buffer.take() {  // .take() moves out of Option
          let multi_change = buf.into_multi_change();
          let _ = output.send(StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi_change));
      }
      *timer = None;  // Clear timer too
  }

  Key Rust Patterns:
  - current_buffer.take() - moves the value out of Option, leaving None
  - &mut parameters - modify the original variables
  - Timer management - clear timer when buffer is flushed

  Usage:
  StageEvent::ContentChange(change) => {
      Self::push_data_point_change_to_buffer(
          change, &mut current_buffer, &mut timer,
          self.max_capacity, self.max_interval, &output
      );
  }

  Does this ownership pattern make more sense?

> Definitely. This makes a consistent image of what's going on and I think I understand the bigger picture. In Java, you 
  always pass references to objects around. In Rust, you can pass access to certain pieces of data in a very fine-grained 
  manner - and with the compiler taking care that nothings goes wrong. Quite a paradigm shift, but it really starts making
   sense.

✻ Thinking…

  The user has really grasped an important concept here about Rust vs Java ownership patterns. They're expressing 
  understanding about how Rust gives fine-grained control over access to data with compiler guarantees, which is indeed a 
  paradigm shift from Java's "everything is a reference to objects" approach.

  Looking at their current implementation, I see they've made good progress but there are a few issues to point out:

  1. In the StateChange branch (line 136-140), they're still using the old direct assignment pattern instead of calling 
  the helper function.
  2. In the ContentMultiChange branch (line 144-149), they're calling push_data_point_change_to_buffer but not using 
  Self:: and not passing all the correct parameters.
  3. They still need to implement the timer branch (line 155).
  4. They need to add the state change forwarding logic.

  But I should praise their understanding first, then guide them to clean up the remaining implementation details.

● Exactly! You've grasped one of Rust's most powerful paradigms!

  Java vs Rust Mental Model:
  - Java: "Everything is a reference to an object somewhere in memory"
  - Rust: "I can precisely control WHO can access WHAT data in WHICH way at compile time"

  This fine-grained access control is what enables Rust's "fearless concurrency" - the compiler guarantees no data races
  because it tracks every access pattern.

  Your Implementation is Almost Complete!

  Looking at your code, you have the core logic working, but a few details need finishing:

  1. StateChange Branch (lines 136-140):
  You're still using the old pattern. Should be:
  StageEvent::StateChange(new_state) => {
      if new_state == StageState::Stalled || new_state == StageState::Completed {
          Self::flush_buffer_and_clear_timer(&mut current_buffer, &mut timer, &output);
      }
      // Don't forget to forward the state change!
      let _ = output.send(StageEvent::StateChange(new_state));
  }

  2. ContentMultiChange Branch (line 145):
  Missing Self:: and parameters:
  Self::push_data_point_change_to_buffer(
      *change,  // or change.clone() depending on iterator
      &mut current_buffer,
      &mut timer,
      self.max_capacity,
      self.max_interval,
      &output
  );

  3. Timer Branch (line 155):
  () = async { timer.as_mut().unwrap().await }, if timer.is_some() => {
      Self::flush_buffer_and_clear_timer(&mut current_buffer, &mut timer, &output);
  }

  You're really close to a complete implementation! Want to tackle these remaining pieces?

> My current problem is that VS Code still gives no detailed error messages in the tokio::select! body but errors the 
  whole part within its {} out with "expected token tree". Is this due to the code not being finished or is there another 
  problem?

● Read(src/storage/event/stage_event_batcher.rs)
  ⎿  Read 172 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The "expected token tree" error in tokio::select! is likely due to syntax issues. Looking at your code, I can spot
  several problems:

  Syntax Issues Causing the Error:

  1. Line 150: Missing = in the match arm:
  StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi_change) {  // ❌ Missing =>
  1. Should be:
  StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi_change) => {
  2. Line 152: Missing Self:: and wrong parameter types:
  push_data_point_change_to_buffer(change,current_buffer,self.max_capacity,output);  // ❌
  2. Should be:
  Self::push_data_point_change_to_buffer(
      *change,  // Need to dereference since it's &DataPointChange from iterator
      &mut current_buffer,
      &mut timer,
      self.max_capacity,
      self.max_interval,
      &output
  );
  3. Empty Timer Branch: Line 163 has no code, which might confuse the macro.

  Quick Fix to Test:
  Try adding the missing => on line 150 first:
  StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi_change) => {

  And add some code to the timer branch:
  () = async { timer.as_mut().unwrap().await }, if timer.is_some() => {
      Self::flush_buffer_and_clear_timer(&mut current_buffer, &mut timer, &output);
  }

  The tokio::select! macro is very sensitive to syntax - one missing token can break the entire macro expansion.

  Try fixing the => first and see if VS Code gives you more specific errors!

> Of course it was the missing "=>". Thanks for pointing out! I fixed that and added the other things you pointed out. But
   now VS Code is unhappy with the "await" in branch 2 (line 153): "remove the await" it says. What's wrong there?

● The issue with line 153 is that you're wrapping the .await in an unnecessary async block!

  The Problem:
  () = async { timer.as_mut().unwrap().await }, if timer.is_some() => {
  //   ^^^^^                                ^^^^^
  //   unnecessary async block wrapper

  The Fix:
  () = timer.as_mut().unwrap(), if timer.is_some() => {

  Why This Happens:
  - tokio::time::sleep() returns a Future
  - Inside tokio::select!, you can directly .await on futures
  - Wrapping it in async { ... } creates a future that returns a future - which is not what you want

  Correct Pattern for tokio::select!:
  tokio::select! {
      // Pattern 1: Await a future directly
      result = some_future => { /* handle result */ }

      // Pattern 2: Await with condition
      result = some_future, if condition => { /* handle result */ }

      // Pattern 3: Just wait for completion (your case)
      () = some_future => { /* timer completed */ }
  }

  So your timer branch should simply be:
  () = timer.as_mut().unwrap(), if timer.is_some() => {
      Self::flush_buffer_and_clear_timer(&mut current_buffer, &mut timer, &output);
  }

  The tokio::select! macro handles the async coordination for you - you don't need to wrap individual futures in async
  blocks!

> Well, it still errors out, now with "`PhantomPinned` cannot be unpinned". PhantomPinned???

● Ah! This is a classic Rust async issue. PhantomPinned appears because futures in Rust need to be "pinned" in memory once
   you start polling them.

  The Problem:
  tokio::time::Sleep (returned by tokio::time::sleep()) is a self-referential future that can't be moved once it starts
  being polled. When you store it in Option<tokio::time::Sleep> and then try to use it in tokio::select!, you're trying to
   move it.

  The Solution - Use Pin:
  use std::pin::Pin;

  // Change your timer type:
  let mut timer: Option<Pin<Box<tokio::time::Sleep>>> = None;

  // When creating timer:
  *timer = Some(Box::pin(tokio::time::sleep(max_interval)));

  // In tokio::select!:
  () = timer.as_mut().unwrap().as_mut(), if timer.is_some() => {
      Self::flush_buffer_and_clear_timer(&mut current_buffer, &mut timer, &output);
  }

  Even Better Solution - Use tokio::time::Interval:
  Actually, for your use case, there's a simpler approach. Instead of recreating the timer each time, use a pattern that
  doesn't require storing the future:

  // Remove timer from state
  let mut current_buffer: Option<DataPointChangeBuffer> = None;

  // In the select:
  tokio::select! {
      Some(event) = input.recv() => {
          // Your event handling logic
      }

      // Only include timer branch when buffer exists
      () = tokio::time::sleep(self.max_interval), if current_buffer.is_some() => {
          Self::flush_buffer_and_clear_timer(&mut current_buffer, &mut timer, &output);
      }
  }

  But this won't work exactly as you designed (timer resets on each loop iteration).

  Recommended Fix:
  Stick with the Pin<Box<>> approach - it matches your design intent perfectly. Add use std::pin::Pin; to your imports and
   update the timer type and usage as shown above.

  Which approach feels better to you?

> I stuck with pin and box. No more squiggly red lines, yeah!
