> Yesterday's session was interrupted unfortunately. Please read CLAUDE.md, manifestos/manifesto-02* and session-protocols/2025-06-20.txt for the
   general frame. I am in the midst of adding event receiving to VizStorage in viz_storage.rs and want to continue there. This is educational, 
  so: I type, you tutor.

● I'll help you continue with adding event receiving to VizStorage. Let me first read the relevant files to understand the current state and
  context.

● Read(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 201 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "manifestos/manifesto-02*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(session-protocols/2025-06-20.txt)
  ⎿  Read 1016 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/storage/visualization/viz_storage.rs)
  ⎿  Read 37 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I can see where you are in the integration process. You're adding event receiving to VizStorage, but there are several syntax and
  logical issues to work through. Let me guide you through the implementation.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Fix VizStorage constructor syntax and event receiver integration
     ☐ Add VizStage::set() method for applying events
     ☐ Implement VizStorage::process_events() method
     ☐ Test event system integration end-to-end

● Looking at your VizStorage implementation, I can see several issues that need fixing:

  Syntax Issues in VizStorage Constructor:

  1. Line 25: event_receiver_result=&arc_of_comp_storage.as_ref().get_event_receiver(1000, Duration::from_millis(50));
    - You're creating a reference to the Result, not extracting the value
    - get_event_receiver() returns Result<UnboundedReceiver<StageEvent>, EventSystemError>
  2. Line 30: Your if let syntax is incorrect - you can't use conditional expressions in struct field initialization like that.

  Logical Issues:

  3. Automatic Event Receiver: Your current design automatically requests an event receiver during VizStorage::new(). This means the event system
   always starts, which might not be what you want.
  4. Error Handling: You're not handling the case where get_event_receiver() returns an error.

  Suggested Fix Strategy:

  I recommend separating the concerns:

  impl VizStorage {
      /// Create VizStorage without event system active
      pub fn new(arc_of_comp_storage: Arc<CompStorage>) -> VizStorage {
          let stage = VizStage::new(&arc_of_comp_storage.stage);
          VizStorage {
              properties: arc_of_comp_storage.properties,
              stage,
              event_receiver: None,  // Start without events
          }
      }

      /// Activate event system - call this when you want real-time updates
      pub fn start_event_updates(&mut self, comp_storage: &CompStorage) -> Result<(), EventSystemError> {
          if self.event_receiver.is_some() {
              return Err(EventSystemError::AlreadyActive);
          }

          let receiver = comp_storage.get_event_receiver(1000, Duration::from_millis(50))?;
          self.event_receiver = Some(receiver);
          Ok(())
      }
  }

  This approach:
  - Separates creation from event activation
  - Handles errors properly
  - Allows VizStorage to exist without events if desired
  - Gives you explicit control over when event system starts

  What do you think about this separation of concerns? Would you like to implement it this way, or do you prefer automatic event activation?

> There is no reason for VizStorage to exist without event receiving once it works. And it is important that events are received _before_ the 
  VizStage is initialized, so that no information gets lost. I changed the code in the constructor accordingly.

● Perfect! Your approach makes complete sense:

  1. Always activate events: If the event system is ready, VizStorage should use it
  2. Events before VizStage: Critical insight! Events need to be active before VizStage is created so no updates are missed during initialization

  Your code changes are much cleaner:
  - Line 4: Fixed import to tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedReceiver
  - Line 25: Using .ok() to convert Result<Receiver, Error> to Option<Receiver>
  - Line 30: Clean assignment to event_receiver field

  I see you started typing pub fn on line 34 - this is probably where you'll add the process_events() method.

  Key Implementation Questions for process_events():

  1. Event Processing Strategy: Should it process all available events in one call, or just one at a time?
  2. Error Handling: What happens if event_receiver is None (fallback case)?
  3. Channel Exhaustion: Use try_recv() in a loop or recv().await for blocking?

  Suggested Implementation Pattern:

  pub fn process_events(&mut self) {
      if let Some(receiver) = &mut self.event_receiver {
          // Drain all available events without blocking
          while let Ok(event) = receiver.try_recv() {
              match event {
                  StageEvent::ContentChange(change) => {
                      self.stage.set(change.x, change.y, change.data_point);
                  }
                  StageEvent::ContentMultiChange(multi) => {
                      for change in multi.changes() {
                          self.stage.set(change.x, change.y, change.data_point);
                      }
                  }
                  StageEvent::StateChange(_state) => {
                      // Handle computation state changes if needed
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      // If no event_receiver, this becomes a no-op (graceful fallback)
  }

  The try_recv() approach is perfect for iced's update cycle - it processes all available events without blocking the GUI thread.

  What method did you want to implement next?
