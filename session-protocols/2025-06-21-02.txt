‚óè Thanks for reading the project documentation! I can see you've built an impressive fractal visualizer with sophisticated architecture. Let me
  share my thoughts on manifesto-03 and suggest an implementation order.

  My Analysis of the Issues

  The manifesto outlines excellent polish and productization work. Your instinct to clean up warnings and improve user experience is spot-on -
  these are the details that separate educational projects from truly usable software.

  Issue 1 (Warnings) - Critical foundation work. Clean warnings help maintain code quality and catch real issues.

  Issue 2 (iced update) - Good timing. Newer versions likely have better documentation and community support.

  Issue 3 (GUI layout) - High impact for user experience. Currently the fractal likely feels cramped.

  Issue 4 (Better coloring) - This could transform the visual appeal dramatically. The separation from computation is architecturally sound.

  Issue 5 (Unfinished visualization) - Clever idea. Interpolation would make progressive rendering much more pleasant.

  Issue 6 (Progress bar) - Essential for user feedback, especially with complex computations.

  Issue 7 (Interactive selection) - Most complex but highest value. This is what makes fractal exploration truly engaging.

  Issue 8 (Module structure) - Good architectural hygiene. The dual storage system is complex enough to benefit from cleaner exports.

  Issue 9 (Documentation) - Critical for the "real release" goal.

  Suggested Implementation Order

  Phase A: Foundation (Issues 1, 2, 8)
  1. Fix warnings first - gives clean baseline
  2. Update iced version - establishes modern foundation
  3. Clean up module structure - makes subsequent work cleaner

  Phase B: Visual Polish (Issues 3, 4, 6)
  4. Improve GUI layout - immediate visual impact
  5. Add progress bar - better user feedback
  6. Implement better coloring - dramatic visual improvement

  Phase C: Advanced Features (Issues 5, 7)
  7. Unfinished point interpolation - enhanced progressive rendering
  8. Interactive area selection - most complex, highest user value

  Phase D: Release Preparation (Issue 9)
  9. Comprehensive documentation - final step before release

  Questions for You

  1. Issue 7 complexity: Interactive selection with data preservation is quite sophisticated. Are you comfortable with the coordinate
  transformation math involved?
  2. Issue 4 scope: How extensive do you want the color system? Just a few predefined schemes, or a full color editor?
  3. Issue 5 interpolation: Simple nearest-neighbor, or more sophisticated interpolation algorithms?

  Would you like to start with Phase A? Issue 1 (warnings cleanup) would be a good first step to establish momentum.

> Your phases make sense, we'll use them as base for the implementation. Can you add this plan please to the manifesto?

       61 +  The issues above will be addressed in the following phases to ensure a logical progression from foundation to advanced features:
       62 +  
       63 +  **Phase A: Foundation (Issues 1, 2, 8)**
       64 +  1. Fix warnings first - gives clean baseline for development

       80    ## Target: Building the minimum viable product
       81    
       82    Having implemented the improvements described here, mandel.rs should evolve into something which can really be used to create nice 
     im
            ages - independently from this project's important educational objective. Having reached this state makes it sensible to produce a 
     exe
            cutable binary and make a "real" release - probably with the help of current Github processes.

‚óè Implementation plan added to manifesto-03! Ready to start with Phase A when you are.

> Regarding your questions from above: (1) I've studied math and had lectures in linear algebra (albeit 34 years ago‚Ä¶). Should be doable. And 
  there are surely libraries available and a certain AI is involved into this project, I heard‚Ä¶ (2) We start with predefined schemes and I will 
  have a surprise for you when it comes to that implementation. :-) (3) We'll dig into this when we are at it.

‚óè Perfect! Your math background will definitely help with the coordinate transformations, and yes, that "certain AI" will be happy to help with
  any tricky linear algebra refreshers. üòä

  I'm intrigued by your "surprise" for the color implementation - sounds like you have something interesting planned!

  Ready to start Phase A with Issue 1 (warnings cleanup) when you are. It's a great foundation step that will give us a clean slate for all the
  exciting work ahead.

‚óè Manifesto 3 with implementation plan committed successfully! Ready to begin Phase A when you are.

> Ok, let's dig into the warnings then. In mandelbrot_engine.rs, "original_properties" is marked as "unused". However, this information _will_ be
   used somewhen in the future. Is it possible to disable this warning in VSCode but make it "resurfaceable" somewhen in the future? Could be 
  that I want to re-evaluate the need of this and other currently unused structures in the future.

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø ¬†‚òê Phase A.1: Fix warnings in VS Code - starting with mandelbrot_engine.rs

‚óè Read(src/comp/mandelbrot_engine.rs)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 186 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Yes! Rust provides several annotation options for managing "future use" warnings. You have two main approaches:

  Option 1: #[allow(dead_code)] attribute
  Add this directly above the field to suppress the warning while keeping it visible in code:

  pub struct MandelbrotEngine {
      #[allow(dead_code)]
      pub original_properties: ImageCompProperties,
      // ... rest of fields
  }

  Option 2: #[cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), allow(dead_code))]
  This allows the warning in debug builds (so you remember it exists) but suppresses it in release builds:

  pub struct MandelbrotEngine {
      #[cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), allow(dead_code))]
      pub original_properties: ImageCompProperties,
      // ... rest of fields
  }

  Option 3: Prefix with underscore (temporary)
  _original_properties - but this changes the API, so probably not ideal here.

  I'd recommend Option 1 since you specifically want it "resurfaceable." The #[allow(dead_code)] is clearly visible in the source, making it easy
   to find and remove when you implement the feature that uses original_properties.

  You could even add a comment explaining the future intent:

  #[allow(dead_code)] // TODO: Will be used for coordinate transformations in Issue 7
  pub original_properties: ImageCompProperties,

  Which approach do you prefer?

> I go for option 1, that's ideal! Unrelated question: In CompStage, could there be any reason why is_computed() does not use internal_get() for 
  aquiring the data? The last line would become then "self.internal_get(idx).is_some()". Any ownership problems with this?

‚óè Read(src/storage/computation/comp_stage.rs)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 124 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Great observation! Looking at the code, your suggested refactor would work perfectly. Currently is_computed() on lines 57-60 duplicates the
  locking logic that internal_get() already handles.

  Current is_computed():
  pub fn is_computed(&self, x: u32, y: u32) -> bool {
      let idx=self.index(x,y);
      self.data[idx].read().unwrap().is_some()
  }

  Your proposed version:
  pub fn is_computed(&self, x: u32, y: u32) -> bool {
      self.internal_get(self.index(x,y)).is_some()
  }

  Ownership analysis: No ownership problems at all! The internal_get() method (lines 62-65) returns Option<DataPoint> by value, not by reference.
   Since DataPoint implements Copy (from your architecture), this is a cheap bitwise copy operation.

  Benefits of your approach:
  1. DRY principle - eliminates duplicate locking code
  2. Consistency - both methods use the same data access pattern
  3. Maintainability - only one place to maintain the locking logic

  This is actually a nice cleanup that improves code quality. The refactor makes perfect sense!

> Ok, I took it a step further and made is_computed() just call get(). Makes perfect sense to me.

‚óè Excellent! Even better - calling get() makes the code more consistent and readable. The method chain get(x,y).is_some() clearly expresses the
  intent: "get the data point and check if it exists."

  This creates a nice layered API:
  - internal_get(idx) - lowest level, works with raw index
  - get(x,y) - public interface, handles coordinate conversion
  - is_computed(x,y) - convenience method, semantic sugar over get()

  Clean refactoring! This eliminates code duplication while making the intent crystal clear. The performance is identical since DataPoint is
  Copy, so no additional overhead from the extra method call layer.

  Ready to continue hunting down more warnings?

> CompStorage::drop_event_receiver() is also marked as unused. However, I am unsure whether this should be called VizStorage::process_events when
   it comes to the StateChange event. I even see a possible place in line 57. Is that sensible or does the whole StageEventBatcher structure 
  dissolves itself once computation is finished?

‚óè Read(src/storage/computation/comp_storage.rs)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 92 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Read(src/storage/visualization/viz_storage.rs)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 68 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Great architectural question! Looking at the code, I can see the lifecycle issue you're identifying:

  Current situation:
  - VizStorage::new() calls CompStorage::get_event_receiver() to start the event system
  - VizStorage::process_events() handles StateChange events but doesn't clean up (line 56-58: "hm...")
  - CompStorage::drop_event_receiver() exists but is never called

  The problem: When computation finishes (StageState::Completed) or stalls (StageState::Stalled), the StageEventBatcher task continues running
  indefinitely, consuming resources.

  Your instinct is correct! Line 57 in VizStorage::process_events() should call drop_event_receiver() to clean up the event system when
  computation ends.

  However, there's an ownership challenge: VizStorage only has Arc<CompStorage> through the constructor, but doesn't store it. To call
  drop_event_receiver(), you'd need to:

  Option 1: Store the Arc in VizStorage
  pub struct VizStorage {
      // ... existing fields
      comp_storage: Arc<CompStorage>, // Add this
  }

  Option 2: Return a cleanup handle from the constructor
  Let the caller handle cleanup when they detect completion.

  Option 3: Make the batcher auto-terminate
  Have StageEventBatcher automatically shut down on Completed/Stalled events.

  Which approach feels most aligned with your architecture? Option 1 seems cleanest - it keeps the lifecycle management internal to VizStorage.

> I just implemented Option 1, that sounds sensible!

‚óè Perfect! That's a clean architectural solution. You've now got proper lifecycle management where:

  1. VizStorage holds the Arc<CompStorage> reference
  2. Event processing automatically cleans up the event system when computation ends
  3. The let _ = self.comp_storage.drop_event_receiver(); pattern ignores the Result since cleanup is best-effort

  This eliminates the resource leak and makes the drop_event_receiver() method actually useful. The StageEventBatcher task will now properly
  terminate when computation finishes, instead of running indefinitely.

  Good architectural instincts! The ownership model is clean - VizStorage has a legitimate reason to hold the Arc<CompStorage> since it needs to
  manage the event system lifecycle.

  Ready to tackle the next batch of warnings?

> Yes. I must ask: Is there only this "allow dead-code" thing? I mean, suppose I write a library. It will surely define lots of functions which 
  are not called by any other parts of the library but which define the public API. Must I add "#[allow(dead-code)]" to all of them? Does not 
  make much sense to me‚Ä¶

‚óè You're absolutely right - that would be terrible for library development! Rust's dead code warnings are much smarter than that.

  Rust only warns about dead code for items that are not part of the public API:

  - pub fn foo() ‚Üí No warning (part of public API, could be used by external crates)
  - fn foo() ‚Üí Warning (private function that's never called internally)

  Exception: If you're building a binary crate (which you are), even pub items get warnings if they're unused internally. This is because Rust
  knows no external crate will use your binary's API.

  For library development:
  - Public functions (pub fn), structs (pub struct), etc. never get dead code warnings
  - Only private, unused items trigger warnings
  - This encourages good API design - if something should be public, mark it pub

  In your case:
  You're building a binary application, so Rust is correctly warning about unused public items since they can't be used by other crates. For
  items you plan to use later, #[allow(dead_code)] is the right approach.

  Alternative approach for "future API":
  Some developers create a _examples or _tests module that calls all the "future" functions, just to prevent warnings without annotations. But
  #[allow(dead_code)] with a comment is cleaner and more explicit about intent.

> Great. This cleanup lead me to a potential problem: It seems that the loop{} in StageEventBatcher::run never ends. This will lead to a resource
   leak, won't it?

‚óè Read(src/storage/event/stage_event_batcher.rs)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 186 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Excellent catch! You're absolutely right. Looking at the code, the loop does terminate, but only under specific conditions:

  The loop terminates when:
  - Line 127: input.recv() returns None (input channel closed)
  - Line 129: return exits the function

  The potential problem: If the input channel stays open but no more events arrive, the loop continues indefinitely. This happens because:

  1. CompStorage::drop_event_receiver() calls self.stage.set_change_sender(None) (line 82)
  2. This disconnects the stage from sending events
  3. But the input channel (comp_receiver) might not get closed immediately
  4. The batcher keeps waiting for events that will never come

  The fix: When drop_event_receiver() is called, it should also close the input channel. Looking at line 84:

  event_system.sender.take().unwrap();  // Dropping the sender automatically closes the channel - according to Claude‚Ä¶

  This should work - dropping the sender closes the channel, causing input.recv() to return None. But there's a timing issue: if the batcher is
  in the timer branch of tokio::select!, it might not check the channel immediately.

  Is this actually a problem in practice? Probably minimal, since:
  1. The task does eventually terminate when the channel closes
  2. The async task is lightweight when idle
  3. Your cleanup in VizStorage::process_events() should trigger proper shutdown

  But you're right to be concerned about resource leaks. The design assumes the channel closing will terminate the loop, which should work but
  isn't immediately obvious from the code.
