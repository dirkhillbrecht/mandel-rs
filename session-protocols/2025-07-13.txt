‚óè I've read the CLAUDE.md file and understand this is an educational Rust project for fractal visualization. The
   project appears to be a complete MVP with comprehensive documentation and interactive features.

  I see you've opened the Manifesto 04 file in your IDE. How can I help you with your mandel.rs project today?

> In the opened manifesto 04 I've written down the set of next development targets. Please have a look and give 
  your opinion: Are these sensible development targets? Do you see any gaps? Do you see something superfluous? 
  Can you give estimations on difficulty for the described issues? Do you have suggestion on ordering?

‚óè Based on my review of Manifesto 04, these are sensible development targets that show good strategic thinking.
  Here's my analysis:

  Strong Points

  - Well-structured progression from GUI polish ‚Üí storage optimization ‚Üí algorithmic improvements ‚Üí deployment
  - Smart architectural improvements like moving to polar coordinates and centralizing state management
  - Performance-focused with practical optimizations (2^Z data retention, parallel computation)

  Difficulty Estimates

  Easy (1-2 weeks):
  - 4.1: Colorization parameters
  - 4.7: Move settings to model
  - 4.17: Tokio update

  Medium (2-4 weeks):
  - 4.2: Stage sizing modes
  - 4.3: PNG export
  - 4.5: Fullscreen mode
  - 4.8: Move drag to app model
  - 4.13: Auto iteration adjustment

  Hard (4-8 weeks):
  - 4.6: Snap zoom with animation
  - 4.9-4.10: Data retention algorithms
  - 4.11: Polar coordinate system
  - 4.15: Parallel computation
  - 4.18: Library extraction

  Very Hard (8+ weeks):
  - 4.16: Boundary trace algorithm
  - 4.19: Internationalization
  - 4.20-4.21: CI/CD automation

  Suggested Ordering

  1. Foundation (4.7, 4.8, 4.17) - Clean up architecture first
  2. Core Features (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5) - User-visible improvements
  3. Performance (4.9, 4.15, 4.13) - Computational enhancements
  4. Advanced (4.11, 4.6, 4.16) - Complex algorithmic work
  5. Deployment (4.18, 4.20, 4.21) - Production readiness

  Minor Gaps

  - Error handling for file operations (PNG export, data files)
  - Configuration persistence for user preferences
  - Undo/redo for navigation operations

  The scope is ambitious but well-reasoned for advancing from MVP to production-quality software.

> Can you please add a section "Claude review" at the end of the manifesto where you write these insights up 
  just as you did here?

  ‚éø ¬†Updated manifestos/manifesto-04-deployment-efficency-polish.md with 50 additions                           
       198    The issues in this manifesto enhance the program in different spots.
       199    Altogether, they increase the whole program considerably.
       200    The target could be a 1.0 version of the program.
