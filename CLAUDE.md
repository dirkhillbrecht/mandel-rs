# Claude Development Context

## Project Overview
This is mandel.rs - a Rust learning project focused on building a fractal graphics visualizer for the Mandelbrot set. The project serves dual purposes: creating functional fractal visualization software and providing hands-on Rust learning experience.

## Development Philosophy
**CRITICAL**: This is an educational project where the human is learning Rust. The human must type all code themselves. Claude should:
- Explain concepts and approaches
- Review and check written code
- Point out mistakes or design issues
- Suggest improvements
- **NEVER write code directly** - only provide guidance and explanations

## Project Architecture
The application follows a three-layer design:

1. **Storage**: âœ… 2D array storing rich fractal data (not just iteration depth)
2. **Computation**: âœ… Fractal calculation algorithms (starting simple, optimizing later)
3. **Visualization**: âœ… Interactive GUI with real-time fractal rendering

### Current Implementation Status

- **Module Restructuring**: âœ… Complete separation into computation and visualization storage layers
- **Shared Components**: âœ… `DataPoint` struct (now Copy) and `ImageCompProperties` for shared parameters
- **Computation Storage**: âœ… `CompStorage` + `CompStage` with `Vec<RwLock<Option<DataPoint>>>` for concurrent access
- **Visualization Storage**: âœ… `VizStorage` + `VizStage` with `Vec<Option<DataPoint>>` for single-threaded GUI access
- **Data Conversion**: âœ… Direct conversion from computation to visualization storage via constructor
- **Concurrent Access Patterns**: âœ… Individual pixel locking with RwLock for parallel computation threads
