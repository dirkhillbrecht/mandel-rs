# Claude Development Context

## Project Overview
This is mandel.rs - a comprehensive educational fractal visualization application built in Rust. The project serves dual purposes: creating a functional, professional-quality fractal exploration tool and providing an extensive hands-on Rust learning experience that demonstrates advanced systems programming concepts.

## Development Philosophy
**CRITICAL**: This is an educational project where the human is learning Rust. The human must type all code themselves. Claude should:
- Explain concepts and approaches
- Review and check written code
- Point out mistakes or design issues
- Suggest improvements
- **NEVER write code directly** - only provide guidance and explanations

## Project Architecture
The application implements a sophisticated three-layer design with comprehensive documentation:

1. **Storage**: ✅ Dual-storage architecture with parallel/sequential access optimization
2. **Computation**: ✅ Multi-threaded fractal computation engine with event streaming
3. **Visualization**: ✅ Modern Iced-based GUI with full interactive navigation

### Implementation Status - COMPLETE MVP ✅
**Storage System**: Fully implemented dual-storage architecture featuring:
- **CompStorage**: Thread-safe parallel access with per-pixel RwLocks for computation threads
- **VizStorage**: Sequential access optimization for UI operations and rendering
- **Event System**: Real-time synchronization with async batching for efficient updates
- **Coordinate Transformations**: Type-safe mathematical coordinate handling with euclid

**Computation Engine**: Production-ready massively parallel computation system:
- **MandelbrotEngine**: Multi-threaded fractal computation with Rayon work-stealing parallelism
- **Mathematical Core**: Optimized complex number algorithms with escape-time computation
- **Parallel Processing**: Per-pixel RwLocks enabling concurrent computation across all CPU cores
- **Color Mapping**: Professional gradient schemes with mathematical assignment functions

- ✅ **Visual Configuration**: Color schemes, iteration mapping, and render options
- ✅ **Progress Display**: Real-time computation status and completion indicators
- ✅ **Preset System**: Curated mathematical regions for exploration

### Interactive Controls Architecture
Complete state-based operation system:
- `CanvasOperation::Idle` - Default state, ready for new interactions
- `CanvasOperation::Drag` - Active panning with real-time visual feedback
- `CanvasOperation::Zoom` - Accumulating zoom operations with timeout-based completion

**Navigation Implementation**: Sophisticated interaction system with:
- **Panning**: Drag-based coordinate translation with deferred computation restart
- **Zooming**: Mouse wheel accumulation with 500ms timeout and coordinate transformation
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate preview during operations before computation restart
- **Data Preservation**: Intelligent preservation of computed data during coordinate changes

## Technical Context
- **Language**: Rust (educational focus)
- **Development**: VS Code with Rust Extension Pack, auto-format on save with rustfmt
- **GUI Framework**: iced 0.13.1 for cross-platform native applications with function-based API
- **Color Science**: palette 0.7.6 for professional color space operations and gradient generation
- **Coordinate System**: euclid for type-safe mathematical coordinate handling
- **Parallel Computing**: rayon for work-stealing parallelism and massively parallel computation
- **Async Runtime**: tokio for non-blocking operations and enhanced threading
- **Streaming**: async-stream for creating finite event streams
