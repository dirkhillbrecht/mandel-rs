# Claude Development Context

## Project Overview
This is mandel.rs - a Rust learning project focused on building a fractal graphics visualizer for the Mandelbrot set. The project serves dual purposes: creating functional fractal visualization software and providing hands-on Rust learning experience.

## Development Philosophy
**CRITICAL**: This is an educational project where the human is learning Rust. The human must type all code themselves. Claude should:
- Explain concepts and approaches
- Review and check written code
- Point out mistakes or design issues
- Suggest improvements
- **NEVER write code directly** - only provide guidance and explanations

## Project Architecture
The application follows a three-layer design:

1. **Storage**: ✅ 2D array storing rich fractal data (not just iteration depth)
2. **Computation**: ✅ Fractal calculation algorithms (starting simple, optimizing later)
3. **Visualization**: ✅ Interactive GUI with real-time fractal rendering

### Current Implementation Status

**Storage Layer (Complete - Dual Architecture Implementation)**
- **Module Restructuring**: ✅ Complete separation into computation and visualization storage layers
- **Shared Components**: ✅ `DataPoint` struct (now Copy) and `ImageCompProperties` for shared parameters
- **Computation Storage**: ✅ `CompStorage` + `CompStage` with `Vec<RwLock<Option<DataPoint>>>` for concurrent access
- **Visualization Storage**: ✅ `VizStorage` + `VizStage` with `Vec<Option<DataPoint>>` for single-threaded GUI access
- **Data Conversion**: ✅ Direct conversion from computation to visualization storage via constructor
- **Concurrent Access Patterns**: ✅ Individual pixel locking with RwLock for parallel computation threads
- **Memory Efficiency**: ✅ Copy semantics for DataPoint, reference-based access in visualization layer
- **Phase I Integration**: ✅ GUI successfully uses dual storage architecture (CompStorage → VizStorage)
- **Ownership Management**: ✅ Proper borrowing semantics for computation function calls
- **Event-Based Communication**: Planned for Phase II/III implementation (manifesto-02)

**Computation Layer (Complete - Integrated with Dual Storage)**
- `simple_mandelbrot.rs`: Core Mandelbrot set algorithm

- Direct complex number math (z² + c) without external dependencies
- Proper handling of max iterations and final escape coordinates
- Verified working algorithm with edge/center point testing
- Integration with dual storage architecture using proper Rust ownership patterns

**Visualization Layer (Complete - Integrated with Dual Storage)**
- `mandel_iced_app.rs`: Interactive GUI application using iced MVU architecture
- Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern with pure functional UI description
- Event-driven architecture with Message enum for all user interactions
- Real-time fractal computation triggered by button clicks
- Dynamic color mapping from iteration counts to RGB values
- Cross-platform window with native look and feel and responsive image scaling
- High-resolution rendering with configurable dimensions and instant visual feedback
- Proper state management (computing vs idle states)
- Interactive parameter input: coordinate bounds (left, right, top, bottom), image dimensions (width, height), and max iterations
- Real-time parameter validation using Rust's Result pattern matching
- Improved layout design with centered alignment and consistent spacing
- Fixed-width input fields (100px) for uniform appearance
- Automatic initial computation on application startup using Command::perform

## Key Rust Concepts Learned
- **Ownership & Borrowing**: `&self` vs `&mut self`, moving vs borrowing data

## Communication Guidelines
- Explain concepts in Java terms when helpful
- Use English for all technical communication
- Focus on educational value over speed
- Encourage hands-on typing and understanding
